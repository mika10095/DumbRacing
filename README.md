Simple "racing" thing made for a dumb university class.
Speed is additive so if you go up you keep going up unless you slow down.

Controls:
Arrow keys for movement.
Space for not moving.

Installs the same as any other Godot project made with Godot 4.4-dev2 but will work in other versions probably.
Editing the map can be done by just editing the tilemap. 
Anything with a tile is valid anything without a tile is going off the map and crashing.
If you want different colors or something you can just modululate any of the unused tiles in the tileset.

Future features if anybody wants them.
-Executable file  (.exe will be provided when the Magister wifi is not horrible and I can download the export templates.)
-Grass
-Text display for the speed and current tile and move count
-Checkpoint system
-Automatic movement by loading in a file
