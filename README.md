## Description
Simple "racing" thing made for a dumb university class.

Speed is additive so if you go up you keep going up unless you slow down.

## Controls
Arrow keys for movement.
Space for not moving.

## Install and edit
Installs the same as any other Godot project made with Godot 4.4-dev2 but will work in other versions probably.
Supports the [Godot Web Editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/)

Alternatively you can just run the executable loaded with a basic map which will probably not change.[^1]

## Editing the map
Editing the map can be done by just editing the tilemap. 
Anything with a tile is valid anything without a tile is going off the map and crashing.

If you want different colors or something you can just modulate any of the tiles in the tileset.

## Future features if anybody wants them.
- Executable file[^1]  
- Grass
- Text display for the speed and current tile and move count
- Checkpoint system
- Automatic movement by loading in a file
